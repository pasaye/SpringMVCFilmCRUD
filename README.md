#Lessons Learned
Four eyes or more eyes: Do you ever find those images online that say "only real geniuses spot all five differences" and you find 4 out of 5 and the harder you look the more everything looks the same and the stupider you feel. Thats what its like to debug code and the only way to break out of that cycle is to have another set of eyes or just a bunch of eyes cause really you can't have to many.
